This project uses MTA turnstile data (data from the NYC subway system) to practice exploratory data analysis (EDA). 

The project was open-ended. I chose to explore where a flagship bicycle shop should be built in the Central Park area of NYC. At the most basic level, I examined whether the shop should be built alongside Central Park or if it would be beneficial to build it a few blocks away. After looking at various visualizations of the MTA data, it was determined that the ideal location for the shop would be near the 96th St station (on line 1-2-3).

The project uses SQL and Python to import, clean, and visualize the data.

The finalized documents include:
- A Jupyter Notebook for the minimum viable product (MVP) assignment
- A Jupyter Notebook with the code for the project
- A brief writeup
- A short (5min) presentation of the project findings
